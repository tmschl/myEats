>> myEats is the second iteration of myTaste. Same concept, same product, only difference… This one works.

# The Idea
* Food apps can be resourceful. We all use them to make the split second decision of go or don't go… Based on the overall ranking.
* The social experience is awkward. Caring about and seeing what other people eat, is just weird.
* myEats is a platform to remember personal favorites, or not so favorites. Without the awkwardness.
* Where you would like to go - Make quick notes of places that look exciting
* Why you would go back - What food you liked. Would it make a good date night? Somewhere to go when family visits?

## API's
* myEats uses google places to load a users search data and a simple script to populate the app with a map

## Meteor
* Real time is cool, but when you think of what this app is going to do, you might not think it's necessary
* You're right. It's not. But it's still cool. Open a few tabs, login, add a thought and check it out in all the tabs! All of them!

## Mongo | Mini-Mongo | Users
* Firstly. Making and persisting users. Easy peezy. How come? Mongo.
* Bottom line… Saving session data client side on mini-mongo is cool.
* Other bottom line… Updating inserting and deleting from mongo server side is cool too. Plus, persistence is good. Right? 
* The answer is yes.

## User Experience
* myEats should be as simple as possible and an overall pleasing experience. Find your place. Leave your thought. Get on with life

## Design
* Any and all product experience needs to leave people in tears for more, while not knowing why.
* Design is unspeakably crucial in creating this affect

## Mobile
* Okay, its not mobile yet. But boy oh boy it will be.
